# üìäDashboard Game Sales

Hello, welcome to this repository! üåª

This repo contains a game sales data analysis dashboard created using Power BI. This is my first experience creating a dashboard with this applicationüòÖ. In addition, with a little knowledge of Figma, I tried to integrate the background design from Figma to give it a minimalist, clean, and gameing vibe.

The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/video-game-sales)

## üß†Insight dan Visualisasi
There are four main types of visualisations created to gain insights from this dataset:

#### 2. Pie Charts
- Percentage/Proportion of Game Genres Released: From 1980 to 2020, there were 11 game genres released. The Action genre had the highest percentage at 19.98% (3,316 games), indicating that this genre is the most popular among the public.

## ‚ú®Direct Benefits of Insight
- **Better Business Decision Making**: Game Development Priorities: By knowing the best-selling game genre (Action) and the publisher with the most releases (Nintendo DS), you can advise game studios or investors to focus on specific genres or replicate the strategies of successful publishers.

- **Geographic Market Targets**: Insights into the highest sales in North America in 2008 can serve as a reference for determining which regions have the greatest market potential during a specific period.

- **Release Strategy**: Trends in the highest number of games released in 2009 can help in understanding market density and determining the optimal release time to avoid being overshadowed by competitors.

- **Under-Explored Genres**: While Action is the most popular genre, visualisation may also reveal other genres with potential that have not been extensively explored. This could present an opportunity for innovation.

- **Future Trends**: Using historical data, you can begin to create simple predictive models to try to forecast future sales trends or genres.
